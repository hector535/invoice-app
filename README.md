#### Test Runner

- Vitest

## Running it locally

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your computer before you can run the project locally.
Once installed, you can proceed to clone the project:

```
    git clone https://github.com/hector535/invoice-app.git
```

Then, change the working directory to the cloned project:

```
    cd invoice-app
```

And finally, install the project's dependencies:

```
    npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://vitest.dev/guide/) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `dist` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.
